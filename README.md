# `direct`
Discrete relaxation of continuous variables for tractable variational inference.

See the paper based on this work [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04279) which will be presented at NIPS 2018 in Montreal.

# TODO:
* add functionality for sampling the variational distribution and add this to the tutorial.
